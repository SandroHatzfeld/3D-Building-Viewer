# 3D-Building-Viewer

I created this building viewer using r3f, gsap and blender. I modeled the building and rooms by myself. 
I used https://gltf.pmnd.rs/ to convert the 3d-files to editable objects to be able to select them and change their properties.

Zustand is used to keep track of the state.
